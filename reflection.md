- What are your initial impressions of Java?
    I thought it was scary but I still kind of think that. It looks funny because the code doesn't translate to English compared to Python. I am not sure when to use methods because they intimidate me. I don't know when to impliment methods becuase I am not sure when to connect the methods with one another. Also I had to google alot of fucntions for java and realized that some methods only work for certain data types. I also realized that you have to mention the data type for every varibale or array that you make.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
    I noticed that you have to state the variable types for evrything when it was optional in Pyhton. Python is not OOP while Java is. Java is sensitive and you have to make the code work before you run where in Python could run then have an error becuase it goes line by line. In python you could do double equation and you cannot do that in Java you need to use the equals method. You have to use squiggly 
    lines to close a for loop or an if statement. I also know that the header comments are different between both lnaguages. In pyhton you have functions but in Java you have methods. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    What worked for me was collaborating with others. I was able to figure out how to do the for loops for rounds and kim found out how to create lists and appending. Then we put our ideas together to format our code. It also put me at ease knowing that others were also lost because didn't feel alone. I recommend others work together to make progress faster and not waste as much time if they work alone. I recommend that students go to TA hours because even if you don't know how Java works they can help you form your thoughts so you find how to use a method.
